## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot possible issues with the integration:
- **Debug mode:** In the integration instance select the option Debug and download the logs under Settings>About>Troubleshooting>Download logs.
- **Mirror values:** To troubleshoot mirroring issues apart from debug mode is possible to check under context that the dbot fields are set.
- This fields under context are: dbotMirrorInstance, dbotMirrorDirection and dbotMirrorId. If they are not set please review the mappers.
- The field dbotMirrorLastSync under context will be updated when the mirroring updates something on the incident, this can be also observed under War Room.

## Best practices

- When mirroring is enable please allow at least 1 minute to see the changes reflected, the mirroring process is executed every 1 minute.
- When reopening option is marked the XSOAR incident will be reopened under 2 conditions:
    - The alert is reopened from Sekoia which will reopen the incident in XSOAR.
    - The XSOAR incident is reopened: when this is done from XSOAR after reopen the incident please quickly change the status of the Sekoia alert or the mirroring will close it automatically due to the mirroring.
