## Advanced SEKOIA.IO Configuration

### API Key
Much like any other API, Sekoio's API relies on an authentication mechanism, utilizing an API key for authentication. Obtaining one requires following a series of simple steps :

- Click on **settings** ( Look on the navbar bottom )
- On **Workspace** part, click on **API keys**
- Click on the + API key button
- Give a name and a description to your key (description should be more than 10 characters and less than 100 characters)
- Select one or more roles to associate with your key. 
- Click on Save
